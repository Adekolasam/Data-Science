    "# Exploring Hacker News Posts\n",
    "\n",
    "Hacker News is a site created by the startup incubator Y Combinator for user-submitted stories. This stories receive votes and comments (similar to reddit). Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of the Hacker News listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "This report aims to explore, and analyze Hacker News dataset of about 20,000 rows to generate meaningful insight and make informed decision. Below are descriptions of the columns: \n",
    "\n",
    "id: the unique identifier from Hacker News for the post\n",
    "- `title`: the title of the post\n",
    "- `url`: the URL that the posts links to, if the post has a URL\n",
    "- `num_points`: the number of points the post acquired, calculated as the total number of upvotes minus the total number of downvotes\n",
    "- `num_comments`: the number of comments on the post\n",
    "- `author`: the username of the person who submitted the post\n",
    "- `created_at`: the date and time of the post's submission\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "We're specifically interested in posts with titles that begin with either `Ask HN` or `Show HN`. Users submit `Ask HN` posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question. Below are a few examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ask HN: How to improve my personal website?\n",
    "- Ask HN: Am I the only one outraged by Twitter shutting down share counts?\n",
    "- Ask HN: Aby recent changes to CSS that broke mobile?\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, users submit Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just something interesting. Below are a few examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Show HN: Wio Link  ESP8266 Based Web of Things Hardware Development Platform'\n",
    "- Show HN: Something pointless I made\n",
    "- Show HN: Shanhu.io, a programming playground powered by e8vm\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll compare these two types of posts to determine the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?\n",
    "- Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?\n"

    "\n",
    "Drawing insights from the report analysis, it is deduced that ask_posts exhibit a greater volume of posts and an elevated average number of comments compared to show_posts. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the optimal time for post creation is at 3 pm, given its association with the highest average comment count per post within a one-hour timeframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon conducting further analysis, the figure shows that other_posts demonstrate a superior average in both comments and points when compared with ask_posts and show_posts. This fact can be attributed to the expansive array of topics encompassed within other_posts, which, hypothetically speaking, may stem from yet-to-be-explored subject matter. Notably, other_posts boasts a substantial dataset of `17,194` records, markedly surpassing the respective counts of ask_posts (`1,744`) and show_posts (`1,162`)."
